### Installation
---


#### Prerequisites

`cooledit` requires the [`FreeType`](http://freetype.org/) library for fonts.
Many features do not work without the support of additional packages.
You will need the files `pkg-config`, `gdb`, `aspell`, `grotty`, `libfreetype.so.6`, and `libX11.so` to be installed on your system.
See [INSTALL.freebsd](https://github.com/paulsheer/cooledit/blob/master/INSTALL.freebsd) for required FreeBSD packages, or check for an available port.
See [INSTALL](https://github.com/paulsheer/cooledit/blob/master/INSTALL) for building the latest `FreeType` from source code and building into `/opt/cooledit`.
For Ubuntu install `libx11-dev`, `libfreetype-dev`, `gdb`, `aspell`, `aspell-en`, and `groff-base`.


#### Quick Build: Install From Source

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

### Usage
---

Here are some startup options for `cooledit`:


```shell
cooledit
cooledit -font large
cooledit -h
coolman gcc
coolman cooledit
```



### Features
---

#### Syntax highlighting

`cooledit` supports over 100 languages, scripts, and file formats.


#### In-place shell support and text processing

`Esc` and a shell command pipes the current highlighted block through the shell command. A very powerful feature.


#### Clipboard history

`cooledit` remembers everything you have cut, copied, or pasted.

#### Unicode Support

`cooledit` has support for most of Unicode 15 and will render almost any
glyph imaginable, as well as the capability to enter raw characters
and determine encoding correctness.

`cooledit` began as the text editor `mcedit` for the Midnight Commander
project in 1998 and was presented by me at the 1999 Atlanta Linux Showcase.
